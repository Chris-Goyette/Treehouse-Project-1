        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>As much as I would like to say that I am an aspiring web developer, the truth is I don't know what I want to do yet. One thing I can say with certainty is that I need to level up my skills - especially if I want to make it in the Bay Area.</p>
        <p>Outside of trying to figure out my life, I work a fulltime job in the fintech industry as an Investor Services Associate for LendignClub. My past roles have included working as a specialist in credit risk analysis and fraud prevention.</p>
        <p>In my most recent role I used SQL and had a small taste of data analysis and because of this, a part of me is saying should pursue learning SQL and Python.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the curious side to me is very interested in web development and the opportunities this skill could bring.</p>
        <p>After mulling about this issue for months, I have decided that the only way to figure out what I want to do is to just take action and see where it goes. </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to complete the Front-End Web Development Techdegree at Treehouse and master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills, and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For good or for worse, I am committed to document my experiences throughout this new chapter in my life. Thank you for supporting me and following me on my journey. See you on the other side!</p>
